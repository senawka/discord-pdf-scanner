I coded a bot for Discord that scans your PDF and sends each individual page.



# but sen, how do I make it work :3c 

well my dear Github neckbeard, you're in luck. Here are the detailed instructions (2 braincells required)


## 1) Download the latest version of Poppler for Windows from the official repository: https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases

## 2) Extract the contents of the downloaded ZIP file to a desired location on your computer.

## 3) Copy the full path to the Poppler bin directory where the executable files are located. For example, the path might look like: C:\path\to\poppler-xx.xx.x\bin

## 4) Add the Poppler bin directory to your system's PATH environment variable:

### Open the Start menu and search for "Environment Variables" and select "Edit the system environment variables".
### In the "System Properties" window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.
### In the "Environment Variables" window, locate the "Path" variable under "System variables" and click the "Edit" button.
### In the "Edit Environment Variable" window, click the "New" button and paste the path to the Poppler bin directory.
### Click "OK" to close all windows.
### Restart your Python environment (e.g., IDE, terminal) to ensure the updated PATH takes effect.




it only took me 30 minutes to code and debug, no thanks required.
